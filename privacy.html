    <h1>Privacy Policy for AceGuardian</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> December 30, 2025</p>
    
    <p>AceGuardian ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle data within the AceGuardian mobile application.</p>

    <h3>1. Privacy-First Architecture (On-Device Processing)</h3>
    <p>AceGuardian is built with a <strong>Privacy-First</strong> philosophy. To ensure maximum security for our users, all AI analysis, audio processing, and safety monitoring occur <strong>locally on your device</strong>. No audio, video, or personal safety data is ever transmitted to, or stored on, our servers.</p>

    <h3>2. Data Collection and Usage</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Microphone Access:</strong> Used solely for real-time safety monitoring via AI. Audio is processed in volatile memory and is never saved or uploaded.</li>
        <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> Used only to provide emergency context. This data stays on your device unless you explicitly trigger a safety alert.</li>
        <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> We do not collect names, emails, or phone numbers unless you voluntarily provide them for support purposes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Data Sharing</h3>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, or share your personal data with third parties. Because we do not store your data on our servers, there is no data "to share."</p>

    <h3>4. Data Retention and Deletion</h3>
    <p>Since all data is processed on-device and in real-time, we do not retain your personal safety data. Users have full control over the app; deleting the app removes all locally stored configuration data.</p>
